  Starting a new open-source project: Foundry 🚀
  
  After 11 years in cloud architecture at Bosch and Siemens, I'm building
  a production-ready multi-tenant LLM serving platform.
  
  Why? LLM serving costs $80-100K/month at scale. Most solutions lack:
  - Real multi-tenancy (not bolt-on)
  - Cost attribution per tenant
  - Production-grade observability
  
  Tech stack: vLLM, Kubernetes, FastAPI
  Goal: <$0.001 per 1K tokens, p99 <500ms
  
  This will be my learning journey in public. Follow along!
  
  GitHub: [link]
  
  Feedback from the ML infrastructure community welcome. 🙏
