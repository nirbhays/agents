# YOUR PATH TO $800K: 12-Month Focused Plan

## 🎯 REALITY CHECK

**Who You Actually Are:**
- **Principal Platform Engineer @ Siemens** (started Dec 1, 2025) - €126K/year
- **Cloud Architect @ Bosch** (3 years) - €60K/year, **16 hrs/week only**
- **Total Compensation:** €186K/year = $202K USD
- **Total Hours:** 56 hrs/week (Siemens 40 + Bosch 16) - NOT 80+
- **Experience:** 11 years cloud architecture, multi-cloud, GenAI/MLOps
- **Certifications:** GCP Professional (Cloud + ML Engineer), AWS Professional, Azure, CKAD
- **Location:** Poland (HUGE advantage for remote US roles)

**The Actual Truth:**
- ✅ Your skills = **$700-850k Staff/Principal level** at elite AI companies
- ✅ Your workload = **Sustainable** (56 hrs work + 12 hrs portfolio = 68 hrs/week)
- ❌ Your public profile = **Invisible** (biggest blocker to $800K)
- ✅ You have TIME for portfolio (Bosch only 16 hrs/week = game changer)
- ⚠️ You just started Siemens = Must stay 15-18 months minimum

**Your Best Path:** Keep both jobs + Build portfolio → Staff/Principal AI Infrastructure Engineer → $750-900k in 18 months
**Probability:** 75-80% if you execute this plan (high confidence)

---

## ⚡ YOUR CRITICAL GAPS (Fix These = $800K)

**What's Blocking You:**
1. ❌ **Zero GitHub Portfolio** (Severity: 10/10) — OpenAI can't find you
2. ❌ **No Technical Blog** (9/10) — Can't prove thought leadership
3. ❌ **Resume Lists Tech, Not Impact** (8/10) — Screened out before interviews

**What You're Underusing:**
1. ✅ Multi-cloud depth (GCP+AWS+Azure) — rare combination
2. ✅ AI Ethics/Governance — Anthropic values this highly
3. ✅ Siemens enterprise scale — startups need this as they grow
4. ✅ Poland location — cost arbitrage advantage ($650k = $800k after COL)

---

## 🔧 ESSENTIAL SKILLS TO LEARN (Prioritized)

**Must Learn (Critical Gaps):**
1. **LLM Internals** (Month 1-2, 10 hours)
   - Read: "Attention Is All You Need", "vLLM" paper
   - Implement: Toy transformer in PyTorch (200 lines)
   - Why: Pass technical deep-dive rounds

2. **System Design for AI** (Month 7-9, 30 hours)
   - Practice: 50 problems from ML System Design book
   - Focus: Multi-tenancy, rate limiting, cost attribution, abuse detection
   - Why: Core of Staff interviews

3. **vLLM/Ray Codebase** (Month 3-6, 20 hours)
   - Study: PagedAttention implementation, Ray Serve architecture
   - Contribute: 5-10 PRs to these projects
   - Why: Shows depth + gets you on recruiter radar

**Skip (Low ROI for Your Path):**
- ❌ More certifications (you have enough)
- ❌ Advanced ML theory (you're infra, not research)
- ❌ Generic Kubernetes courses (you have CKAD)

---

## 💰 REALISTIC COMPENSATION TARGETS

**Your Current Market Value:**
- Without portfolio: $400-500k (FAANG Senior)
- With portfolio: $650-750k (AI company Staff)
- With portfolio + brand: $800k-$1M (elite AI Staff)

**12-Month Target (Realistic):**
- **Path A:** $700k full-time at Databricks/Cohere (65% probability)
- **Path B:** $600k full-time + $200k consulting = $800k (55% probability)
- **Path C:** $500k full-time + $300k consulting = $800k (45% probability)

**Net Income (Poland):**
- Gross $800k = ~$544k net after Polish taxes
- Equivalent to $1M gross in San Francisco (after taxes + COL)

---

## 🚨 TOP 5 MISTAKES TO AVOID

1. **Collecting More Certs Instead of Building Portfolio**
   - You have GCP Pro, AWS Pro, Azure, CKAD = ENOUGH
   - Every hour on certs = wasted hour not building GitHub stars

2. **Applying Before Portfolio is Ready**
   - Applying with no GitHub = auto-rejection
   - Wait until Month 6 minimum (portfolio + blog live)

3. **Generic Resume (Tech Lists, Not Impact)**
   - "Worked on cloud platforms" = screened out
   - "Reduced costs $1.8M via multi-cloud optimization" = interview

4. **Not Negotiating Offers**
   - First offer will be $600k, you need $800k
   - Always negotiate, need 2+ competing offers for leverage

5. **Giving Up After 3-5 Rejections**
   - Normal funnel: 15 applications → 2 offers
   - Expect 10-15 rejections before landing $800k role

---

## 📚 ESSENTIAL RESOURCES (Only What You Need)

**Books (Read These 3):**
1. **"Machine Learning System Design"** by Chip Huyen — For interviews
2. **"Designing Data-Intensive Applications"** by Martin Kleppmann — For system thinking

**Communities (Join These 2):**
1. **MLOps Community Slack** — Network with target company engineers
2. **EleutherAI Discord** — LLM/OSS community

**Skip:**
- ❌ More online courses (you learn by building, not watching)
- ❌ Coding bootcamps (you already code)
- ❌ Networking events (remote companies hire via GitHub, not conferences)

## 🚀 12-18 MONTH ROADMAP TO $800K

### Phase 1: Build Undeniable Proof & A Principal's Portfolio (Months 1-6)

#### **Goal:** Create a portfolio that unequivocally demonstrates "Principal-level AI Infrastructure" leadership and impact. This isn't just about building things; it's about building *systems that enable others* and have measurable business outcomes.

**Project 1: The "AI Platform Multiplier" (Open Source)**
- **Vision:** An open-source, multi-tenant LLM serving platform designed for enterprise-grade reliability, cost-efficiency, and scale.
- **Key Features:**
    - **High-Performance Inference:** Leverage vLLM, Ray Serve, and TensorRT-LLM for state-of-the-art throughput on models like Llama 3, Mistral, and Mixtral.
    - **Radical Cost Optimization:** Target and document a path to <$0.001 per 1K tokens, showcasing a 10x cost reduction over standard OpenAI APIs. This is a business-critical metric.
    - **Unified Observability Stack:** Integrate Prometheus, Grafana, and Langfuse/OpenLLMetry for a "single pane of glass" view into latency, cost, and model performance.
    - **Multi-Cloud & Hybrid Deployment:** Demonstrate your core strength by providing Terraform and Kubernetes manifests for seamless deployment on AWS, GCP, and on-premise GPU clusters.
- **Principal-Level Metrics:**
    - **Scale:** Handle 100,000 requests/minute with a p99 latency < 500ms.
    - **Cost:** Detailed cost-per-tenant and cost-per-model tracking.
    - **Adoption:** Target 1,000+ GitHub stars and get 3+ external contributors. This proves your work is a valuable foundation for others.

**Why This Matters:** You're not just building a tool; you're building a *platform that multiplies the efforts of other engineers*. This is the essence of a Principal Engineer.

**Project 2: The "Agentic Operating System"**
- **Vision:** A framework for building, deploying, and managing reliable, multi-agent AI systems. Go beyond simple ReAct loops.
- **Key Features:**
    - **Agent Supervisor & Orchestrator:** Design a meta-agent that can delegate tasks, manage state, and handle errors across a team of specialized agents (e.g., a "researcher" agent, a "coder" agent).
    - **Dynamic Tool Integration:** Create a secure system for agents to discover and use new tools (APIs, databases, code interpreters) on the fly.
    - **Production-Grade Reliability:** Implement robust error handling, automatic retries with backoff, and comprehensive cost controls to prevent runaway agentic processes.
    - **Build Your Own Langchain/LlamaIndex:** Demonstrate deep, fundamental understanding by building the core components from scratch, not just wrapping existing libraries.

**Why This Matters:** This shows you are thinking about the next frontier of AI—not just using LLMs, but orchestrating them into complex, value-creating systems.

**Technical Blog: The "Principal's Voice"**
- **Goal:** Establish yourself as a thought leader who can articulate complex technical decisions and their business impact.
- **Blog 1:** "The $100k GPU Question: A Principal Engineer's Guide to LLM Serving Cost Optimization" (Targets business and tech leaders).
- **Blog 2:** "Beyond ReAct: Architecting a Production-Ready Multi-Agent AI System" (Showcases forward-thinking design).
- **Blog 3:** "vLLM vs. TensorRT-LLM vs. DeepSpeed: A Definitive Production Benchmark for 2026" (Provides immense value to the community).
- **Platform:** Your personal blog (essential for brand) cross-posted to Medium, HackerNews, and relevant subreddits.
- **Goal:** 100,000+ views and significant engagement that positions you as a go-to expert.

**Why This Matters:** Principal engineers don't just build; they influence the industry. Your blog is your primary tool for scaled influence.

**Your Response:**
```
Thank you for the offer! I'm very excited about OpenAI and the LLM Infra team.

Based on my 11 years of experience, my contributions to [open source project], and competitive offers I'm considering, I was hoping for:
- Base: $280k
- Equity: $400k/year

This would put total comp at $755k, which aligns with my expectations for a Staff-level role.

Would this be possible?
```

**Likely Outcome:**
- Base: $265k (+$15k)
- Equity: $350k/year (+$50k)
- **New Total: $690k**

**Getting to $800K:**
- **Path A:** Negotiate harder (esp. if you have competing offer from Anthropic)
- **Path B:** Accept $690k, get promoted to Senior Staff (L7) in 18-24 months → $900k+
- **Path C:** Join high-growth startup with equity upside (riskier)

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### **1. Your GitHub Is Your Resume**
At $800k level, your GitHub matters MORE than your resume. Companies want to see:
- Code quality (clean, tested, documented)
- Scale thinking (handles 10K QPS, not 10 QPS)
- Production-ready (monitoring, error handling, CI/CD)

**Your LLM Platform needs to be EXCEPTIONAL (top 1% quality)**

---

### **2. Become Known in the Community**
Staff engineers are "known" - blogs, talks, open source. You need:
- 1 viral blog (HackerNews frontpage)
- Active LinkedIn (post 3x/week, 3,000+ followers)
- Conference talk OR popular YouTube series

**Goal:** When OpenAI recruiter searches "LLM infrastructure", you appear

---

### **3. Interview Performance > Everything**
Even with perfect portfolio, you need to **ace staff-level interviews**:
- System design: Design for 100x scale, discuss trade-offs
- Technical depth: Explain WHY (not just HOW)
- Coding: LeetCode Medium in 30 min (consistently)
- Behavioral: 10x impact stories

**Practice is non-negotiable: 100+ hours interview prep**

---

### **4. Location Strategy**
You're in Poland. Options:
- **Remote US roles:** OpenAI, Anthropic, Scale AI, Databricks (hire remote)
- **Europe + US comp:** Some companies pay US salaries for EU remote
- **Relocation:** Willing to move to SF/NYC? (Higher comp, but taxes)

**For $800K, you likely need US company (EU salaries cap at $300-400k)**

---

## 💰 COMPENSATION NEGOTIATION GUIDE

### **Anatomy of $800K Offer:**
- **Base:** $250-300k (40%)
- **Bonus:** $75-150k (10-15%)
- **Equity:** $375-450k/year (45-50%)

**Key Insight:** To get $800k, you need **high equity grant**

---

### **Negotiation Script (After Initial Offer):**

**If Offer is $600k:**
```
Thank you for the offer! I'm very excited about [Company] and [specific project].

Based on my 11 years of experience, my work on [LLM Platform with 1000+ stars], contributions to [vLLM/Ray], and competitive market data for Staff Engineers with AI infrastructure expertise, I was expecting total compensation in the $750-800k range.

Specifically, I was hoping for:
- Base: $280k
- Equity: $420k/year

Would there be flexibility here?
```

**Recruiter Response Paths:**

**Path A: "Let me check with the team"** (Good sign)
- They'll likely come back with $680-720k
- Accept if $700k+

**Path B: "That's at the top of our band"** (Need leverage)
- Ask: "What would it take to get there? Performance expectations?"
- OR: "I have a competing offer at $750k from [Company]. Can you match?"

**Path C: "We can't go higher"** (Walk or accept)
- If you have no other offers: Accept $600k, plan to get promoted to Senior Staff (18-24 mo) → $900k+
- If you have better offer: "I appreciate the offer, but I've accepted another role. I'd love to stay in touch for future opportunities."

---

### **Multiple Offers (Best Leverage):**

**Scenario:** You have offers from:
- **OpenAI:** $650k ($260k base + $390k equity)
- **Anthropic:** $700k ($270k base + $430k equity)
- **Databricks:** $580k ($240k base + $340k equity)

**Strategy:**
1. Tell OpenAI about Anthropic offer: "I have another offer at $700k. I prefer OpenAI because [reason]. Can you match?"
2. OpenAI likely matches: $690-720k
3. Take highest offer OR best culture fit (if within 10%)

**Note:** Don't bluff about offers (recruiters verify)

## 🌍 LOCATION CONSIDERATIONS (POLAND)

### **Remote US Roles:**
**Companies that hire EU remote for US salaries:**
- ✅ OpenAI (remote-friendly)
- ✅ Anthropic (remote-first)
- ✅ Scale AI (remote)
- ✅ Databricks (remote)
- ❌ Google (requires office presence)
- ❌ Meta (limited remote for Staff+)

**Tax Impact:**
- Poland income tax: ~32% (vs US 35-40%)
- USD→PLN exchange rate risk
- US company pays gross salary; you handle Polish taxes

**Net Take-Home (on $800k):**
- Gross: $800k
- Polish taxes: ~$256k (32%)
- **Net: ~$544k** (~2.1M PLN/year)

---

### **Alternative: Relocate to US?**
**Pros:**
- Higher gross comp ($800k → $1M for same role)
- Larger network (easier to find next job)
- More companies (not limited to remote-friendly)

**Cons:**
- SF/NYC cost of living: $80-120k/year
- US taxes: 35-45% (federal + state)
- Work visa (H1B or O1) - complex process

**Net Take-Home Comparison:**
- **Poland (remote $800k):** ~$544k net (~2.1M PLN)
- **US (onsite $1M):** ~$550k net after taxes + COL

**Verdict:** Poland remote is **financially equivalent** for $800k roles

## ⚠️ RISKS & REALITIES

### **Reality Check: $800K Is HARD**
- **Top 1-2% of tech compensation globally**
- **Staff+ level at elite companies** (OpenAI, Anthropic, quant firms)
- **High interview bar** (90%+ of candidates fail)
- **Luck plays a role** (timing, hiring freezes, market conditions)

### **Probability Assessment:**
**With your background (11 years, GenAI, multi-cloud):**
- **20-30% chance:** $700k-$1M at OpenAI/Anthropic (if you execute this plan perfectly)
- **50-60% chance:** $500k-$700k at Tier 2 AI companies (Databricks, Hugging Face)
- **80-90% chance:** $400k-$500k at FAANG AI teams (Google, Meta)

**Key Variables:**
1. **Portfolio quality** (is your LLM platform GitHub top 1%?)
2. **Interview performance** (can you design systems at Staff level?)
3. **Market timing** (is AI hiring hot in 18 months?)
4. **Network/referrals** (do you have intros to hiring managers?)

## 🎯 UPDATED RECOMMENDATIONS (BASED ON 2026 MARKET RESEARCH)

### **CRITICAL ADDITIONS: Missing Elements for $800K**

#### **1. EXPAND TARGET COMPANIES (You're Missing These)**

**Crypto/Web3 (Often Overlooked, $600k-$1.5M):**
- **Coinbase** (Staff Engineer): $600k-$900k (base-heavy, stable)
- **Ripple** (Principal Engineer): $550k-$850k
- **Circle** (Staff Platform Engineer): $500k-$800k
- **Kraken** (Principal SRE/MLOps): $450k-$750k

**Why Add These:** Crypto companies pay FAANG+ comp but have less competitive interviews than OpenAI

**Defense Tech (Hot in 2026, $500k-$1.2M):**
- **Anduril** (Staff AI Engineer): $600k-$1M
- **Palantir** (Forward Deployed Engineer - AI): $550k-$950k
- **Shield AI** (Principal ML Engineer): $500k-$850k

**Why Add These:** Defense tech is booming post-2025; they need AI infrastructure experts desperately

**Enterprise AI (More Accessible, $450k-$750k):**
- **Snowflake** (Staff ML Platform): $500k-$750k
- **MongoDB** (Principal Engineer - AI): $450k-$700k
- **Elastic** (Staff Engineer - ML): $400k-$650k

**Why Add These:** Lower interview bar than pure AI companies; stable with strong comp

---

#### **2. ADD "QUANTIFIABLE WINS" TO YOUR RESUME (CRITICAL)**

**Your Current Problem:** Your resume likely lists technologies, not IMPACT

**What $800K Candidates Have:**
- "Reduced LLM inference costs by 73% ($2.4M annual savings) using vLLM and spot instances"
- "Architected multi-tenant AI platform serving 10M requests/day with p99 latency <200ms"
- "Led migration of 50 ML models to Kubernetes, improving deployment time from 2 weeks to 2 hours"

**Action Plan:**
- **Week 1:** Audit your 11 years of experience
- **Week 2:** Quantify EVERYTHING:
  - Cost savings (exact dollars)
  - Performance improvements (latency, throughput in numbers)
  - Scale (requests/second, data volume, users)
  - Team impact (engineers led, systems built)
- **Week 3:** Rewrite resume with "Result-Action-Context" format

**Example Transformation:**
- ❌ **Before:** "Worked on cloud migration and MLOps pipelines"
- ✅ **After:** "Led $5M cloud optimization initiative, reducing AWS costs 34% ($1.7M/year) while migrating 120 ML models to GKE with 99.95% uptime"

---

#### **3. BUILD "T-SHAPED" EXPERTISE (Not Just Breadth)**

**Your Current Profile:** Generalist (multi-cloud, MLOps, GenAI) ← Good but not $800K-differentiating

**$800K Engineers Have:** T-shaped = Broad knowledge + ONE deep specialization

**Choose ONE Deep Specialty (Next 6 Months):**

**Option A: LLM Inference Optimization** (Highest Demand)
- Master vLLM codebase (contribute 10+ PRs)
- Become THE expert in quantization (GPTQ, AWQ, GGUF)
- Write definitive blog: "Complete Guide to 10x Faster LLM Serving"
- Goal: When companies need LLM optimization, they find YOU

**Option B: Multi-Tenant AI Platforms** (Enterprise Goldmine)
- Build reference architecture (GitHub repo with 1,000+ stars)
- Speak at conferences: "Architecting Multi-Tenant LLM Platforms"
- Consult for 2-3 startups (even free) to build case studies
- Goal: Become THE authority on AI multi-tenancy

**Option C: AI FinOps** (Emerging High-Value Niche)
- Build cost attribution system for ML workloads (open source)
- Create "AI FinOps Playbook" (e-book, 50+ pages)
- Speak at FinOps conferences
- Goal: Rare expertise that CFOs care about = premium pricing

**Why This Matters:** Staff+ engineers are hired for SPECIFIC problems. "I do everything" doesn't get $800K. "I'm THE expert in X" does.

---

#### **4. LEVERAGE YOUR 11 YEARS (You're Underselling This)**

**Reality:** 11 years experience should get you Principal level, not Staff

**Principal Engineer Comp (Higher Than Staff):**
- OpenAI L7: $900k-$1.5M
- Anthropic Principal: $850k-$1.3M
- Databricks Principal: $700k-$1.1M

**How to Position as Principal Candidate:**
- Lead architecture reviews (document 5-10 major decisions you made)
- Show cross-team influence (how you affected 50+ engineers)
- Demonstrate strategic thinking (3-5 year roadmaps you created)
- Publish architecture decision records (ADRs) on GitHub

**Add "Principal-Level Artifacts" to Portfolio:**
1. **Architecture Decision Records:** 5-10 ADRs from your career (sanitize company info)
2. **Tech Strategy Doc:** "3-Year AI Infrastructure Roadmap" (based on your experience)
3. **Design Docs:** 3-5 system design docs (open source projects you build)

---

#### **5. ADD "CONSULTING/ADVISORY" TRACK (Parallel Path)**

**Why:** You can hit $800K+ FASTER through consulting while building toward full-time roles

**90-Day Consulting Launch Plan:**

**Month 1: Positioning**
- Create "AI Infrastructure Consulting" website (simple, professional)
- LinkedIn headline: "AI Infrastructure Consultant | Ex-11yr Cloud Architect | Helping companies cut LLM costs 50-80%"
- Create lead magnet: "AI Infrastructure Cost Optimization Checklist" (PDF)

**Month 2: Outreach**
- Identify 50 Series A-C AI startups (Crunchbase, AngelList)
- Cold email: "I noticed [Company] is scaling AI. I helped [specific result]. Free 30-min audit?"
- Goal: 3-5 paid projects ($10-20k each)

**Month 3: Delivery + Testimonials**
- Overdeliver on first projects
- Get video testimonials
- Post case studies (with permission)

**Year 1 Revenue Potential:**
- 20 hours/week @ $300/hour = $312k/year
- Or: 3-4 retainer clients @ $8-10k/month = $300-400k/year
- **PLUS:** Consulting clients become references for full-time roles

**Why This Works:**
- You already have 11 years expertise (just need to package it)
- Poland location = lower cost of living (more profitable)
- Consulting proves your value → easier to negotiate full-time offers

---

#### **6. INTERVIEW PREP: ADD "STAFF-LEVEL SIGNALS"**

**What You're Missing:** Staff interviews test INFLUENCE, not just technical skills

**Add These to Interview Prep:**

**Influence Stories (Prepare 5):**
1. **Cross-Team Impact:** "Convinced 3 teams to adopt unified ML platform, saving $500k"
2. **Technical Vision:** "Proposed 3-year AI infrastructure roadmap adopted by CTO"
3. **Conflict Resolution:** "Mediated disagreement between ML and Infra teams on..."
4. **Mentorship:** "Mentored 8 engineers; 3 promoted to senior roles"
5. **Process Improvement:** "Introduced RFC process, reducing architectural debacles 80%"

**Strategic Thinking Questions:**
- "How would you design AI infrastructure for a company scaling 0→1M users?"
- "If you were CTO, how would you prioritize: cost reduction, reliability, or feature velocity?"
- "Design a 3-year technology roadmap for an AI-first company"

**Practice With:** Senior engineers (not just peers); Ask them to grill you on STRATEGY
