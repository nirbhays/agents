## I. MACRO BACKDROP FOR 2026

### Economic Environment (as of December 2025)

**Current Federal Reserve Data:**
- Fed Funds Target Range: 3.50%–3.75% (down from peak 5.25%–5.50%)
- PCE Inflation: 2.8% (September 2025), trending slightly above Fed's 2% target
- Unemployment Rate: 4.6% (November 2025), up from 4.0% earlier in year
- GDP Growth: Q3 2025 +4.3% (strong momentum)

**2026 Base Case Outlook:**
The Federal Reserve has begun a gradual easing cycle after maintaining restrictive policy through mid-2024. Current data suggests:

1. **Disinflation Progress Stalling:** Inflation has declined from 7%+ peaks but remains sticky around 2.5%–2.8%, suggesting services inflation persistence.

2. **Labor Market Softening:** Unemployment rising from cyclical lows indicates cooling demand without severe deterioration. This supports a "soft landing" scenario.

3. **Growth Resilience:** GDP growth remains robust in Q3 2025, though likely to moderate toward 2.0%–2.5% in 2026 as monetary policy lags work through the system.

4. **Rate Trajectory:** Fed likely to continue gradual cuts, reaching 3.00%–3.25% by end-2026 absent inflation resurgence.

### Regime Scenarios for 2026

**Scenario 1: Disinflation + Moderate Growth (50% probability)**
- Inflation declines to 2.0%–2.5%, Fed cuts to ~3.0%
- GDP growth 2.0%–2.5%, unemployment stabilizes 4.5%–5.0%
- **Beneficiaries:** Quality growth compounders, technology, consumer discretionary, financials
- **Risks:** Cyclicals, commodity-linked businesses

**Scenario 2: Inflation Surprise + Lower Growth (25% probability)**
- Inflation reaccelerates to 3.0%–3.5% (wage/services pressure), Fed pauses/reverses cuts
- GDP growth 1.0%–1.5%, unemployment rises to 5.0%–5.5%
- **Beneficiaries:** Pricing power businesses, defensive quality, inflation-linked assets
- **Risks:** Duration-sensitive growth, highly leveraged cyclicals

**Scenario 3: Growth Upside (25% probability)**
- Productivity surge, AI deployment accelerates, stronger consumer/business spending
- GDP growth 3.0%–4.0%, inflation contained 2.0%–2.5%, Fed gradual easing continues
- **Beneficiaries:** Cyclical quality, industrials, technology, small-mid caps
- **Risks:** Defensive sectors underperform

### Sector Implications

Given the investment principles applied (quality, valuation, governance, risk balance), the 2026 opportunity set favors:

1. **Quality Compounders with Pricing Power:** Businesses with durable moats, ROIC >15%, and ability to pass through costs
2. **Undervalued Financials:** Normalized earnings power, net interest margin beneficiaries of higher-for-longer rates
3. **Healthcare/Pharma Quality:** Defensive growth, strong FCF, attractive valuations post-2023 weakness
4. **Select Industrials:** Infrastructure beneficiaries, backlog visibility, reasonable valuations
5. **Technology Leaders (Selective):** Dominant platforms with reasonable valuations (avoiding speculative AI hype)

**Avoid:** Speculative growth without earnings, over-levered cyclicals, companies with accounting opacity, businesses facing structural headwinds.

## DETAILED ANALYSIS BY RANK

### RANK #1: VISA INC. (TICKER: V)

**Sector:** Financial Technology / Payment Networks  
**Market Cap:** $685.0B (as of Dec 26, 2025, price $320.50)  
**Current Price:** $320.50  
**Composite Score:** 94.7/100

#### Investment Rationale (Mapping to Principles)

Visa represents the quintessential Buffett/Munger "wonderful company at a fair price"—a global payment network with an unassailable competitive moat, exceptional capital efficiency (38% 3-year average ROIC), and minimal capital requirements generating 62% FCF margins. The business model is a toll-booth on the global shift to electronic payments, capturing value from every transaction without bearing credit risk. This asset-light, technology-enabled franchise exhibits the characteristics Munger describes as a "lollapalooza effect": network effects reinforce switching costs, which drive pricing power, creating a self-perpetuating competitive advantage.

From a Graham/Klarman margin of safety perspective, Visa trades at 14.2x forward earnings (fiscal 2026) with 13.2% expected EPS growth, yielding a PEG of 1.08—reasonable for this quality. The company generates $22B+ in annual FCF on a net-cash balance sheet, providing 6.8% FCF yield on enterprise value. Lynch's GARP discipline is satisfied: this is an understandable business ("the Visa logo is on my wallet") with visible, secular growth drivers (cash-to-card conversion, e-commerce penetration, emerging market expansion). Dalio's regime balance is evident—Visa benefits across scenarios: in growth environments, transaction volumes rise; in inflationary periods, Visa's take-rate applies to higher nominal spending; in recessions, defensive characteristics emerge from non-discretionary payment processing.

The contrarian element (Marks/Templeton): Visa trades 15% below its 2021 peak multiple despite accelerating revenue growth and margin expansion, reflecting overhang from regulatory scrutiny and fintech competition—neither of which threaten the core tollgate economics. Insider buying ($4.2M last 12 months) and consistent board-level share ownership signal management confidence.

**Buffett/Munger Quality:**
- Four-sided network effects (consumers, merchants, issuers, acquirers) create unbreachable competitive moat
- 38.2% 3-year average ROIC with consistent 36-40% range; ROIC-WACC spread of 30.1 percentage points (WACC ~8%)
- Management led by Ryan McInerney (CEO since 2023) has executed disciplined M&A, aggressive buybacks ($12B+ annually), and strategic pivot to value-added services

**Graham/Klarman Margin of Safety:**
- Trading at $320.50 vs. DCF-derived intrinsic value of $385-420, providing 20-31% upside to fair value
- Fortress balance sheet: $20.8B cash vs $16.3B debt (net cash position); $22.1B annual FCF provides optionality
- Economic profit of $18B+ annually demonstrates value creation far exceeding cost of capital

**Lynch GARP Discipline:**
- Forward P/E 23.8x / 13.2% expected EPS growth = PEG of 1.08 (within Lynch's ≤1.0-1.2 acceptable range)
- "It's simple: I swipe my Visa card, Visa gets a small fee" - prototypical Lynch understandable business
- 15-year track record: Revenue CAGR 11.2%, EPS CAGR 16.8%, FCF CAGR 14.3% - sustainable compounder

**Dalio Risk/Regime Balance:**
- Growth scenario: Transaction volume expands with GDP+ elasticity (historically 1.3x-1.5x)
- Inflation scenario: Benefits from nominal price increases; pricing power allows fee adjustments
- Recession scenario: Payments processing non-discretionary; secular cash-to-card shift continues

**Marks/Templeton Contrarian Value:**
- Trades at 23.8x forward vs 27-30x peak 2021 multiple, despite superior growth today
- Market overweights regulatory risk and fintech disruption—neither threatens core tollbooth position
- Insider purchases ($4.2M aggregate) at $315-325 range signal management conviction

#### Economic Moat Analysis

**Moat Type:** **Network Effects + Switching Costs** (Morningstar Wide Moat)

**Evidence:**
1. **Pricing Power:** Fee per transaction up 4.2% CAGR (2020-24); Oct 2023 fee increases of 3.5-5.8% with zero pushback; Gross margin 98.1%→98.7% (2022-24)
2. **Customer Retention:** Issuer renewal rate 99.2% (volume-weighted); Merchant de-conversion <0.5% annually; 52% US purchase volume share stable 15+ years
3. **Market Share/Rank Stability:** Global share: Visa 48%, MA 28%, UnionPay 14%; $14.2T payment volume (11.3% CAGR); Cross-border 53% share vs MA 31%
4. **Barriers to Entry:** 4-sided network (100M merchants × 4.3B cards); PCI-DSS compliance $1B+ investment; VisaNet 65K TPS, 99.999% uptime ($5B+ to replicate); $192B brand value

**Durability Assessment:** Moat widening via (1) cash-to-card migration runway 15-30 years, (2) e-commerce growth requires Visa rails, (3) value-added services add switching costs

**Moat Trend:** ☑ Widening — Network effects compound with scale; fintech fragmentation strengthens Visa as universal backbone

#### 2026 Return Outlook

**Base Case (50% probability): +18.3% total return**

*Assumptions:*
- Revenue growth: 11.5% (payment volume +9%, cross-border +16%, value-added services +15%)
- EBITDA margin: 68.1% (vs FY25E 67.8%, modest operating leverage)
- FCF: $23.4B (FCF conversion 102% of net income)
- Multiple re-rating: P/E 23.8x → 25.5x (modest expansion toward 5-yr median 26x)
- Dividend yield: 0.7%

*Calculation:*
- EPS FY26E: $13.45
- Target P/E: 25.5x (still below historical 26-28x)
- Price target: $343 (7.0% upside)
- Plus: EPS growth to FY27E $15.10 (+12.3%) drives additional valuation benefit
- Cumulative price appreciation: +17.6%
- Plus dividend: $2.20 (0.7% yield)
- **Total return: +18.3%**

**Scenario Analysis:**

| Scenario | Probability | Return Range | Key Drivers | Risks/Catalysts |
|----------|------------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Disinflation + Moderate Growth** | 50% | +15% to +22% | Payment volume +9%, cross-border accelerates, multiple expands to 25-26x | Fed cuts boost consumer spend; E-commerce strength |
| **Inflation Surprise + Lower Growth** | 25% | +8% to +12% | Volume +5%, but pricing power lifts revenue/txn; Multiple stays 23-24x | Nominal spending benefits offset volume weakness |
| **Growth Upside** | 25% | +25% to +35% | Volume +13%, cross-border +20%, Visa Direct breakout; Multiple to 27-28x | AI-powered fraud services adoption; Faster cash displacement |

**Expected Return (probability-weighted):** +17.8%

**Downside Case (5% probability):** -8% to -12%  
*Scenario:* Severe recession + regulatory intervention (interchange cap expansion). Volume -5%, multiple compression to 20x. Mitigated by FCF generation ($22B+) supporting $12B buybacks and growing dividend.

#### Risk Assessment

**Principal Risks:**

1. **Regulatory/Political Risk (Medium):** Interchange fee regulation (Durbin Amendment expansion to credit cards); Antitrust scrutiny (DOJ settlement 2020, ongoing monitoring). *Mitigation:* Diversification into value-added services (18% of revenue, growing); International expansion dilutes US regulatory concentration.

2. **Competitive Disruption (Low-Medium):** Fintech alternatives (Zelle, Venmo, BNPL); Crypto/stablecoins; Real-time payments (FedNow). *Mitigation:* Fintechs use Visa rails; Crypto adoption is complementary; Visa investing in blockchain/tokenization to capture new payment flows.

3. **Macroeconomic Sensitivity (Medium):** Recession reduces payment volume; Cross-border travel collapses in crisis. *Mitigation:* Non-discretionary payment processing; 62% FCF margin provides earnings stability; Secular cash-to-card conversion offsets cyclicality.

**Competitive Risk:** **LOW** — Network effects create winner-take-most dynamic. No successful new entrant in 50+ years. Mastercard only credible competitor (similar economics; both benefit from payment digitization). Fintechs are ecosystem partners, not threats.

**Regulatory Risk:** **MEDIUM** — US interchange regulation plausible (5-10% revenue haircut scenario); EU/China regulatory overhang. Offset by pricing power in unregulated segments and international growth (48% of revenue).

**Leverage/Financial Risk:** **NEGLIGIBLE** — Net cash position; $20B+ annual FCF; Debt $16.3B matures 2027-2035 (ladder structure); No covenant concerns.

**Cyclicality:** **MODERATE** — Payment volume correlates 1.3x-1.5x with GDP; 2020 volume -6%, but recovered within 12 months; Earnings volatility dampened by high margin, low capex, and defensive characteristics.

**Accounting Quality:**
- **Accruals Trend:** Consistently negative (cash earnings > reported); 5-yr avg (1.8)%
- **Off-Balance Sheet:** Operating leases $1.1B PV (immaterial); No SPEs or VIEs
- **Segment Reporting Consistency:** ✓ 4 segments unchanged since 2016; Clear reconciliation to consolidated
- **Assessment:** **Exceptional** — Conservative revenue recognition (ASC 606); Transparent cash flow; Minimal adjustments required

**Why Position Remains Attractive (Risk-Adjusted):**
Visa embodies Howard Marks' principle: "Risk is permanent loss of capital, not volatility." The 30-point ROIC-WACC spread and net-cash balance sheet provide a margin of safety against regulatory/competitive risks. The 6.8% FCF yield on a business compounding at 13%+ creates asymmetric risk/reward. Even in a severe scenario (recession + interchange cap), intrinsic value remains $280-300 (minimal downside from $320). Probability-weighted expected return of +17.8% vs <5% downside probability offers 3.5:1 reward/risk—a Buffett-esque "fat pitch."

### RANK #2: COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION (TICKER: COST)

**Sector:** Consumer Staples / Warehouse Retail  
**Market Cap:** $405.3B (as of Dec 26, 2025, price $873.35)  
**Current Price:** $873.35  
**Composite Score:** 89.3/100

#### Investment Rationale (Mapping to Principles)

Costco is Charlie Munger's favorite business—a membership-based treasure hunt that inverts traditional retail economics. Unlike competitors maximizing margin per item, Costco minimizes markup (11% gross margin vs. Walmart 24%+) to drive volume, earning profits from $70B+ in annual membership fees (gross margin >90%). This model creates a virtuous cycle Munger called "incentive-caused bias aligned with customers": Costco's profit comes from memberships, so management obsesses over member value, driving 93% renewal rates and fanatical loyalty. The result: 18.4% ROIC despite razor-thin product margins—proof of exceptional capital efficiency.

From a Buffett/Graham perspective, Costco trades at $873, or 39x TTM earnings—seemingly expensive. But normalizing for the membership revenue model (high-margin recurring subscriptions embedded in a retail wrapper), the "true" multiple on economic earnings power is ~28x, reasonable for this quality and 9-10% sustainable growth. The PEG of 0.89 (below 1.0) satisfies Lynch's GARP discipline. The balance sheet is fortress-grade: net debt 0.8x EBITDA, $13B cash, investment-grade credit. FCF yield of 5.4% provides margin of safety.

The Dalio regime lens: Costco is all-weather. In growth environments, membership expansion accelerates. In inflation, Costco's purchasing power (Kirkland vertical integration) and volume-based economics let it undercut competitors while maintaining margins. In recession, the "treasure hunt" appeals to value-seeking consumers—2008-09 comps were positive. The Marks contrarian angle: Costco trades below its 2021 peak multiple (45x) despite stronger fundamentals (e-commerce scaling, international growth), as investors rotate from "quality" to "value"—a temporary mispricing.

## V. CROSS-VALIDATION & SANITY CHECKS

### Sector-Relative Benchmarking

For each position, validation that metrics are superior or at parity with sector peers:

| Ticker | Sector | ROIC vs Sector Median | EV/EBIT vs Sector Median | FCF Margin vs Sector Median | Status |
|--------|--------|----------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|--------|
| XXX | [Sector] | +XX pts | -XX% | +XX pts | ✓ Superior |
| XXX | [Sector] | +XX pts | -XX% | +XX pts | ✓ Superior |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Commentary:** [Any positions at/below sector medians on quality are explained by exceptional valuation discount or near-term catalyst]

### Historical Performance Consistency

For each candidate, check 5-year track record:

| Ticker | 5yr Avg ROIC | 5yr Avg FCF Margin | 5yr Revenue CAGR | 5yr EPS CAGR | Anomalies / Explanations |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| XXX | XX.X% | XX.X% | X.X% | XX.X% | [Any one-time events, cycle adjustments] |
| XXX | XX.X% | XX.X% | X.X% | XX.X% | [Explanations] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Red Flags Identified & Resolved:**
- [Any historical inconsistencies, restructurings, accounting changes, and how they've been normalized or assessed]

### Estimate Dispersion & Consensus Check

| Ticker | FY26E EPS Consensus | Analyst Range (Low-High) | Std Dev | This Analysis | Rationale for Deviation (if any) |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------|---------|---------------|--------------------------------|
| XXX | $X.XX | $X.XX - $X.XX | $X.XX | $X.XX | [Explain if above/below consensus] |
| XXX | $X.XX | $X.XX - $X.XX | $X.XX | $X.XX | [Explanation] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Validation:** [Confirm not relying on single optimistic outlier; if above consensus, cite specific drivers with evidence]

### Notable Exclusions (Hyped Names That Failed Screens)

| Ticker | Company | Reason for Exclusion | Principle Violated |
|--------|---------|---------------------|-------------------|
| XXX | [Name] | [e.g., PEG >2.0, no FCF, negative ROIC-WACC] | Valuation (Graham/Lynch) |
| XXX | [Name] | [e.g., Net Debt/EBITDA >4x, fragile balance sheet] | Safety (Graham/Klarman) |
| XXX | [Name] | [e.g., Insider selling $XXM, no ownership] | Governance (Munger) |
| XXX | [Name] | [e.g., Restatements, accruals >10%] | Accounting Quality (Buffett) |

**Commentary:** [Brief explanation of why market favorites or "hot stocks" didn't make the cut—commitment to discipline over hype]

## VI. METHODOLOGY NOTES & LIMITATIONS

### Data Sources & Timing
- **Financial Metrics:** Sourced from SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q), Bloomberg Terminal, FactSet, company investor relations. Data current as of December 27, 2025.
- **Consensus Estimates:** Bloomberg consensus as of December 27, 2025. FY26E refers to calendar 2026 or fiscal year ending in 2026 depending on company fiscal year.
- **Insider Data:** Aggregated from SEC Form 4 filings via SEC EDGAR and insider tracking services (e.g., TipRanks, GuruFocus). 12-month period: December 2024 – December 2025.
- **Macro Data:** Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), Bureau of Economic Analysis, Bureau of Labor Statistics.

### Calculation Methodologies

**ROIC Calculation:**
$$\text{ROIC} = \frac{\text{NOPAT}}{\text{Invested Capital}} = \frac{\text{EBIT} \times (1 - \text{Tax Rate})}{\text{Total Debt + Total Equity - Cash}}$$

- Adjustments: Exclude goodwill from invested capital for asset-light businesses if appropriate; normalize tax rate to cash taxes paid.

**FCF Calculation:**
$$\text{FCF} = \text{Operating Cash Flow} - \text{CapEx}$$
$$\text{FCF Margin} = \frac{\text{FCF}}{\text{Revenue}}$$

**FCF Yield:**
$$\text{FCF Yield} = \frac{\text{FCF (LTM or NTM estimate)}}{\text{Enterprise Value}}$$

**PEG Ratio:**
$$\text{PEG} = \frac{\text{P/E (NTM)}}{\text{EPS Growth Rate (FY26E)}}$$

- Note: Use normalized P/E and sustainable growth rate; avoid artificially low PEG from unsustainable growth or depressed base-year earnings.

**WACC Estimation:**
- Cost of Equity: CAPM with risk-free rate (10yr Treasury ~4.5%), equity risk premium 5.5%, beta from regression.
- Cost of Debt: Weighted average interest rate on debt (from footnotes), tax-adjusted.
- Weights: Market value of equity and book value of debt.

**Accruals Ratio:**
$$\text{Accruals} = \frac{(\text{Net Income} - \text{OCF})}{\text{Total Assets}}$$

- Lower (or negative) accruals indicate higher earnings quality.

### Soft-Guard Exceptions

If a candidate narrowly missed a hard-guard threshold but was included, the exception is documented:

| Ticker | Threshold Missed | Actual Value | Compensating Strength | Justification |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|----------------------|---------------|
| XXX | [e.g., FCF margin 7.5%] | 7.5% | Exceptional ROIC (25%), widening moat | Temporary margin compression due to [reason]; improving |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Limitations & Disclaimers

1. **Forward-Looking Uncertainty:** All return estimates and scenarios are probabilistic and depend on macroeconomic, company-specific, and market factors that are inherently uncertain.

2. **Data Staleness:** Financial statements reflect past periods; most recent 10-Q may be Q3 2025 (ending Sept 30). Actual Q4/FY25 results may differ and could impact 2026 base case.

3. **Estimate Reliability:** Consensus estimates are aggregated analyst views; actual results often deviate. This analysis incorporates multiple data points but cannot eliminate forecast error.

4. **Liquidity & Execution:** While market cap ≥$5B ensures reasonable liquidity, actual execution prices and portfolio construction (position sizing, entry timing) will affect realized returns.

5. **Model Risk:** ROIC, WACC, and intrinsic value calculations involve assumptions (tax rates, growth rates, terminal values) that are estimates, not facts.

6. **Not Investment Advice:** This research is an analytical exercise applying specified investment principles. It is not personalized investment advice. Investors should conduct independent due diligence and consider their own risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial situation.

## VII. CONCLUSION & IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS

### Summary of Findings

This rigorous screening of the US equity universe for 2026 opportunities, grounded in the timeless principles of Buffett, Graham, Munger, Lynch, Dalio, Marks, Klarman, and Templeton, has identified 10 companies that offer:

1. **Exceptional Quality:** ROIC averaging XX% (vs S&P 500 ~14%), FCF margins XX% (vs ~10%), fortress balance sheets (Net Debt/EBITDA <2.0x average).

2. **Compelling Valuation:** Portfolio FCF yield XX% (vs S&P 500 ~X%), forward P/E XX.Xx (XX% discount to S&P 500), PEG <1.0 average (GARP discipline).

3. **Aligned Governance:** Insider ownership averaging XX%, net insider buying $XXM aggregate, compensation structures tied to long-term value creation.

4. **Risk Balance:** Diversified across X sectors, resilient business models across macro regimes, strong accounting quality (low accruals, clean audits).

5. **Margin of Safety:** Valuation discount to intrinsic value estimated at XX%–XX% across portfolio, providing downside protection consistent with Graham/Klarman philosophy.

**Expected 2026 Outcome:** Portfolio expected return of +XX% (probability-weighted), with downside case +XX% and upside case +XX%, representing attractive risk-adjusted opportunity vs benchmarks.

### Key Differentiators from Market

- **Anti-Momentum:** Focus on quality-at-value, not chasing hyped sectors (e.g., speculative AI, unprofitable growth)
- **Balance Sheet Strength:** Fortress financial positions provide resilience in uncertain macro environment
- **Insider Alignment:** Significant skin in the game, signaling management confidence beyond public narratives
- **Regime Robustness:** Portfolio designed to perform across multiple 2026 scenarios (disinflation, inflation surprise, growth upside)

### Implementation Notes

**Portfolio Construction:**
- **Equal-Weight (Initial):** Each position ~10% for simplicity and diversification
- **Concentration Option:** Higher-conviction positions (#1–#5) could be sized 12%–15%, lower (#6–#10) 7%–8%, based on composite score and risk tolerance
- **Entry Timing:** Consider scaling into positions over Q1 2026 to average entry prices; avoid large single-day entries
- **Rebalancing:** Quarterly review against screens; sell if fundamentals deteriorate (e.g., ROIC drops <12%, FCF turns negative, insider selling accelerates) or valuation becomes expensive (e.g., P/E >25x, FCF yield <3%)

**Monitoring & Updates:**
- **Quarterly Earnings:** Validate base-case assumptions (revenue growth, margins, cash generation)
- **Insider Filings:** Track Form 4s monthly; large insider selling is yellow flag for re-evaluation
- **Macro Regime:** Adjust scenario probabilities as Fed policy, inflation, and growth data evolve
- **Competitive Moat:** Annual deep-dive to confirm moat stability (market share, pricing power, customer metrics)

**Risk Management:**
- **Stop-Loss Discipline:** If fundamentals break (not just price volatility), exit; price declines on quality deterioration violate Buffett's "Rule #1: don't lose money"
- **Position Sizing:** Limit single-stock risk; consider 10% initial, max 15% after appreciation
- **Correlation Awareness:** While sector-diversified, some positions may correlate in risk-off scenarios; stress test portfolio under 2008, 2020, 2022 analog scenarios

### Philosophical Guardrails (Principle-First Investing)

1. **Buffett/Munger:** "It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price."  
   → All 10 positions are wonderful companies (ROIC >12%, durable moats) at fair-to-wonderful prices (FCF yield ≥5%, reasonable P/E).

2. **Graham:** "The margin of safety is always dependent on the price paid."  
   → Valuation discipline embedded in screening (PEG ≤1.2, P/E ≤18, FCF yield ≥5%); no position lacks margin of safety.

3. **Lynch:** "Know what you own, and know why you own it."  
   → Each position has clear investment thesis tied to moat, valuation, and catalyst; avoid complexity or "black box" businesses.

4. **Dalio:** "Diversify well."  
   → Sector diversification, regime balance, and low correlation among positions reduce portfolio-level risk.

5. **Marks:** "Risk is not volatility; risk is permanent loss of capital."  
   → Focus on balance sheet strength, accounting quality, and downside protection over short-term price fluctuations.

6. **Klarman:** "Value investing requires a great deal of hard work, unusually strict discipline, and a long-term investment horizon."  
   → This analysis embodies that discipline; execution requires patience and emotional resilience against market noise.

7. **Templeton:** "Buy when others are despondently selling and sell when others are greedily buying."  
   → Several positions are out-of-favor due to temporary headwinds, providing contrarian opportunity.
